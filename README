# Insurance Transaction Processor

Minimal claims intake and validation API built with .NET 8, EF Core, and SQL Server.  
Validates claims against policy rules, records an event trail, and exposes endpoints to submit, validate, and list claims.

## Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK  
- Docker Desktop (for SQL Server container)

## Run
1. Start Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
2. Set the connection string in Insurance.Api/appsettings.json under ConnectionStrings:Sql
3. Create the database:
dotnet ef database update --project Insurance.Infrastructure --startup-project Insurance.Api
4. Start the API:
dotnet run --project Insurance.Api
5. Open Swagger at the URL printed by the app

## Quick test (curl)
Seed a sample policy:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/policies/seed
That’s the full README — no extras, no breaks.
Do you also want me to make a version that looks a bit “fancier” (like adding **Features**, **Endpoints**, and maybe badges at the top), or just keep it plain and minimal like this?
